### First of all...
The following charts were created by stevenoh0908, to help enjoying flights and ATC communication.
Although I haven't received any official recognition from the developer yet,
But I'm sure that you can improve your level of ATC communication, which leads toward more realistic flight simulator.
  Thank you, hope you have a nice flight today.
